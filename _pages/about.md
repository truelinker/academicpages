Hello, This is Myung Guk Lee. I know it is not easy to pronounce, so I let people call me as 'Myung' which is easier to say my full Korean name. I'm from S.Korea, and I'm living in the southen California. My firmware development career started in 2005, so I have over 17 years of experience. But compared to my 17 years of experience, my skills are not quite good. I'm not as good as I thought, but I made this website to record and show my career so far.
